Bottom Line: I want to define clades of interest (groups of interest - glochidia-bearing mussels, Lampsilis, blue clams, ect) 
and determine what genes (loci) resolve that clade and record its support value. 
I hope the final output will look something like:

LOCI		support values for Blue Clams		Support values for Green Clams		...	
L1					90									0							...			
L2					0									100										
...
L813				50									90							...							


Each of the *.splits.nex files represents a "tree" based on a single locus (gene)

FcC_aa_L1.skinny.fas.splits.nex 		# tree from Locus 1 (L1)
FcC_aa_L2.skinny.fas.splits.nex			 # tree from Locus 2 (L2)
...
FcC_aa_L813.skinny.fas.splits.nex		 # tree from Locus 813 (L813)

Each of these files contains two bits: TAXA and SPLITS

TAXA describes what species are represented at this loci.  My data was
generated using "shotgun sequencing" so some loci have all 70 species represented, while others loci have
less species represented (sometimes considerably less). 
This complicates things as the numbers in TAXLABLES won't jive between loci. 

For example:
L2
[1] 'Unionidae_Gonideinae_Gonidiea_angulata'
[2] 'Unionidae_Gonideinae_Pilsbryoconcha'
[3] 'Unionidae_Ambleminae_Plectomerus_dombeyanus'
[4] 'Unionidae_Gonideinae_Lamprotula_cornuumlunae'
[5] 'Unionidae_Rectidentinae_Trapezoideus_foliaceus'

L5
[1] 'Cyrenidae_Cyreninae_Cobicula_sp'
[2] 'Etheriidae_Etheriinae_Etheria_elliptica'
[3] 'Hyriidae_Hyriinae_Hyridella_australis'
[4] 'Margaritiferidae_Margaritiferinae_Margaritifera_hembeli'
[5] 'Mycetopodidae_Anodontitinae_Anodontites_elongata'

"We" could redefine the taxa numbers in each file based on a full reference or "find/replace" numbers with species name

The second part "SPLITS" describes the bootstrap support (a measure of confidence)
for ALL the recovered clades based on that locus

 bootstrap support					Clade
	83	 					7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 19,
	85	 					6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 19,
	92	 					1 2 5 20 29 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 49,
	...						...

I want to define clades of interest (INPUT), look for those clades in the SPLITS of each *.splits.nex,
and then print the bootstrap value for the clades of interest to that outfile I mentioned earlier

INPUT - defines clades of interest

Blue_Clams = Unionidae_Ambleminae_Plectomerus_dombeyanus, Unionidae_Ambleminae_Amblema_plicata, Unionidae_Ambleminae_Reginaia_ebenus
Green_Clams = Unionidae_Unioninae_Unio_gibbus, Unionidae_Unioninae_Oxynaia_jourdyi, Unionidae_Unioninae_Nodularia_douglasiae, Unionidae_Unioninae_Cuneopsis_pisciculus, Unionidae_Unioninae_Arconaia_lanceolata

Finding these strings in each of *.splits.nex would be really straight forward if each of the 
species in the defined clades was represented in each locus but they are not. 

In order to grab the bootstrap value for the clade of interest, it must include all the species defined in INPUT and nothing else, 
unless that the species is not represented in that loci.

INPUT
purple_clam = 2,3,4,5

L1
TAXLABLES 1,2,3,4,5,6		This loci contains sequences from each of the species of purple_clam

95			2,3,4,5 		found purple clams		grab bootstrap		includes all purple clams represented in this locus
70			4,5				not clade of interest	do nothing			includes only some purple clams
95			2,3 			not clade of interest	do nothing			includes only some purple clams			
70			1,6				not clade of interest	do nothing
100			1,2,3,4,5,6		not clade of interest	do nothing


L2 
taxa list 1,2,4,5,6			This loci contains sequences for all the purple clams except '3' so find "purple clams (sans 3)"

70			2,4,5			found purple clams		grab bootstrap		includes all purple clams represented in this locus
100			4,5				not clade of interest	do nothing			includes only some purple clams
70			1,6				not clade of interest	do nothing
100			1,2,4,5,6		not clade of interest	do nothing

L3
taxa list 1,2,3,4,5,6
70			3,4,5			not clade of interest	do nothing			missing '2'
100			4,5 			not clade of interest	do nothing			missing '2', '3'
100			2,3,4,5,		found purple clams		grab bootstrap		includes all purple clams represented in this locus
100			2,3,4,5,6		not clade of interest	do nothing			includes a non-purple clam	


To grab bootstrap it must include all purple clams and nothing else. 
if one or more of the purple clams are not represented in that loci, find the ones that are, and thatâ€™s it.



I'd also like to grab some values from another set of files for each loci "*.iqtree" and add them to the output

LOCI		support value for Blue Clams		Support value for Green Clams	#Taxa	PI			TL			IB		
L1					90									0						70		49582		3.4312		0.9585	
L2					0									100						40		49582		2			.75		
...
L813				50									90						10		49582		1			.25		

#Taxa = Input data: 70
PI = Number of parsimony informative sites: 49582
TL = Total tree length (sum of branch lengths): 3.4312
IB = Sum of internal branch lengths: 0.9585
